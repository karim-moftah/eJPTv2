### Vulnerability Overview

**What Is a vulnerability**

"A weakness in the computational logic (e.g., code) found in software and hardware components that, when exploited, results in a negative impact to confidentiality, integrity, or availability. 

<br />

**What Is a CVE?**

CVE stands for Common Vulnerability and Exposure. CVE is a standardized,  unique identifier assigned to security vulnerabilities or exposures in  software and hardware products [1]. The CVE system facilitates accurate  tracking and management of security issues across diverse platforms,  vendors, and technologies, empowering users, vendors, and regulatory  authorities to efficiently identify, catalog, prioritize, and remediate  potential cybersecurity threats.

The mission of the CVEÂ® Program is to identify, define, and catalog publicly disclosed cybersecurity [vulnerabilities](https://www.cve.org/ResourcesSupport/Glossary?activeTerm=glossaryVulnerability). There is one [CVE Record](https://www.cve.org/ResourcesSupport/Glossary?activeTerm=glossaryRecord) for each vulnerability in the catalog. The vulnerabilities are  discovered then assigned and published by organizations from around the  world that have partnered with the CVE Program. [Partners](https://www.cve.org/PartnerInformation/ListofPartners) publish CVE Records to communicate consistent descriptions of  vulnerabilities. Information technology and cybersecurity professionals  use CVE Records to ensure they are discussing the same issue, and to  coordinate their efforts to prioritize and address the vulnerabilities. 

<br />

**What is the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)**

The CVSS is one of several ways to measure the impact of  vulnerabilities, which is commonly known as the CVE score. The CVSS is  an open set of standards used to assess a vulnerability and assign a  severity along a scale of 0-10. The current version of CVSS is v3.1,  which breaks down the scale is as follows:

| **Severity** | **Base Score** |
| ------------ | -------------- |
| None         | 0              |
| Low          | 0.1-3.9        |
| Medium       | 4.0-6.9        |
| High         | 7.0-8.9        |
| Critical     | 9.0-10.0       |

**What is a zero-day vulnerability?**

A zero-day vulnerability is a vulnerability in a system or device that has been disclosed but is not yet patched. An  exploit that attacks a zero-day vulnerability is called a zero-day  exploit.

<br />

**What is zero-day (0day) exploit**

A zero-day (0day) exploit is a cyber attack targeting a software  vulnerability which is unknown to the software vendor or to antivirus  vendors. The attacker spots the software vulnerability before any  parties interested in mitigating it, quickly creates an exploit, and  uses it for an attack. Such attacks are highly likely to succeed because defenses are not in place. This makes zero-day attacks a severe  security threat.

Typical attack vectors include Web browsers, which are common targets due to their ubiquity, and email attachments that exploit  vulnerabilities in the application opening the attachment, or in  specific file types such as Word, Excel, PDF or Flash.
